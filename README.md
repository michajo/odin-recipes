<h1>It starts here</h1>
This is the first part of my journey in the Odin Project.
<br/>I will add to this readme as I go.

<p>The assignment is complete, perhaps I will revisit this in the future...</p>
<p>The links on the index.html pages are formatted in a way that allows them<br>
to display correctly on Github Pages, locally they would need to be changed...</p>

<h3>The Future:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add some style up in here...</li>
<li>I can see how this could be a framework...</li>

</ul>
